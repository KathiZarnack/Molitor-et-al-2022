We analysed PURAs in vivo binding behaviour to RNAs in iCLIP experiments. Theses scripts contain the R code used to

* Define and characterise PURA binding sites
* Predict RNA accesibility and 5-mer frequencies considering mature transcript seqeunces
* Compare the crosslink patterns in three different PURA iCLIP experiments
